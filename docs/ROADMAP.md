# Schubert — Directions

**Version:** 0.1.0 — Foundation complete. IA-conformant. Licensed.
**Gitflow:** `main` (releases) ← `develop` (integration) ← `feature/*` (work)

---

## Current State

Schubert provides a practical access control library built on Schubert calculus.
It is embeddable, synchronous, and depends only on `amari-enumerative` (plus
optional `karpal-proof`, `serde`, `rayon`). The core API is implemented and
tested at 30 unit tests, 0 warnings.

**Completed since foundation:**
- ✅ IA ecosystem conformance (rust-toolchain, phantom types, no_std scaffolding)
- ✅ `serde` feature gate (derives on 11 key types)
- ✅ `karpal` integration (Proven, Property hierarchy, Rewrite, law checks)
- ✅ `parallel` feature gate (check_batch, stability_batch, compose_batch via rayon)
- ✅ AGPL-3.0 dual-licensing (commercial licenses available)

## Near-Term (Practical)

### 1. Computation Path Selection — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** All 4 amari computation paths exposed via `check_with_path()`:
- `LittlewoodRichardson` — exact, classical (default)
- `Localization` — equivariant localization (Atiyah-Bott), better scaling for large Gr(k,n)
- `Tropical` — tropical intersection (fast, approximate counts)
- `Matroid` — polynomial-time independence check

Auto-routing via `check_auto()`: Gr(k,n) with n ≤ 8 uses LR, larger uses Localization.

**Verified:** σ₁⁴=2 and σ₂·σ₁₁=0 consistent across LR, Localization, and Tropical paths.
Matroid correctly detects impossibility.

### 2. Serialization and Persistence — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Full `AccessController` serde with roundtrip fidelity:
- `Serialize` + `Deserialize` on `AccessController` (audit sink skipped)
- `Principal.granted_capability_ids` tracks grants for namespace reconstruction
- `rebuild_principal_namespaces()` restores amari namespaces after deserialization
- `to_json()` / `from_json()` convenience methods
- `save_to_file()` / `load_from_file()` file I/O (requires `std`)

**Verified:** 8 roundtrip tests covering empty controller, capabilities, principals,
access decisions (including σ₁⁴=2 and σ₂·σ₁₁ impossibility), grants, revokes, and file I/O.

### 3. Policy Language

**Current:** Capabilities are defined programmatically in Rust. No declarative specification.

**Direction:** A simple policy language (TOML, YAML, or a custom DSL) for defining capabilities, principals, and grants:

```toml
[grassmannian]
k = 2
n = 4

[capabilities.read_data]
partition = [1]
kind = "ReadLike"
label = "Read data"

[principals.alice]
grants = ["read_data", "write_data"]
```

Parsed at startup. Validated against the Grassmannian. This enables policy-as-code with geometric guarantees.

### 4. WebAssembly Target

**Current:** Depends on `amari-enumerative`, which is not wasm-ready on all paths.

**Direction:** A `wasm` feature that compiles to WebAssembly. Embed Schubert access control in browser-based applications, edge functions, and serverless environments. Enables client-side policy validation with the same geometric guarantees.

### 5. Context-Aware Decisions — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** `AccessContext` with resource, time, and metadata:
- `check_with_context()` extends standard checks with resource scoping
  and time-based trust degradation
- Resource-scoped capabilities: `"cap/resource_id"` checked in addition
  to base capability when context.resource is set
- Time-aware trust: trust factor decays linearly from 1.0 (fresh) to
  0.0 (2+ years old), scaling configuration counts
- Builder methods: `AccessContext::empty()`, `for_resource()`, `at_time()`

**Verified:** 4 tests (resource scoping, empty context matching standard
check, time degradation, no-time no-degradation).

## Medium-Term (Research-Adjacent)

### 6. Multi-Grassmannian Controllers

**Current:** One `AccessController` = one Grassmannian Gr(k,n). Cross-domain access requires multiple controllers.

**Direction:** A `MultiController` that manages multiple Grassmannians with cross-domain capability translation. A principal in Gr(2,4) accessing a resource in Gr(3,6) requires a morphism between Grassmannians — the Schubert calculus of flag varieties provides this.

### 7. Proof-Carrying Capabilities — ✅ PARTIALLY DONE (v0.1.0)

**Current:** Karpal proof integration complete. `Proven<IsValidCapability, Capability>`,
property hierarchy (`IsAdminLike: Implies<IsWriteLike>: Implies<IsReadLike>`),
Rewrite rules, and law checks all implemented behind `karpal` feature.

**Remaining:** Full cryptographic capability tokens (signature verification, distributed
verification). This requires external crypto — see direction below.

### 8. Temporal Access Control

**Current:** Capabilities are permanent until revoked.

**Direction:** Timed capabilities with automatic expiry. The stability engine naturally models this — a capability with expiry time T has a trust level that decays to zero at T, crossing walls at predictable intervals. The phase diagram becomes a calendar.

### 9. Quantitative Rate Limiting

**Current:** Access is binary-geometric. No notion of rate.

**Direction:** Blend Schubert intersection with token-bucket rate limiting. The intersection number determines the bucket capacity — access with 2 configurations gets 2× the rate of access with 1. The geometry of access maps to the geometry of throughput.

## Far-Term (Speculative)

### 10. Schubert Routing

Access decisions as routing rules. A network where route advertisement = capability grants and forwarding = Schubert intersection. The number of valid routes between source and destination is the intersection number. Congestion is codimension excess. This is the networking model explored in the ShaperOS transport layer, extracted as a standalone protocol.

### 11. Access Control for Holographic Memory

Integration with Minuet-style holographic memory systems. Capabilities are binding vectors in a holographic reduced representation. Access is granted when the query vector's similarity to the capability vector exceeds the trust threshold. The wall-crossing engine determines which memories are accessible at each trust level.

### 12. Surreal Trust Levels

When `amari-surreal` supports generalized surreal numbers beyond the dyadic layer, trust levels could be surreal-valued — enabling infinite descending chains of trust degradation. A capability that becomes unstable at trust level ε (infinitesimal) remains stable at all finite trust levels but can be distinguished from one that becomes unstable at ε².

### 13. Constitutional Verification

When formal verification tooling (karpal-proof, karpal-verify) matures, capability partitions and access decisions become machine-checkable. A principal cannot be granted capabilities whose Schubert intersection exceeds specified bounds. The access controller's correctness is proved against the Schubert calculus axioms.

### 14. Distributed Access Control with CRDTs

Operadic composition over a distributed system using conflict-free replicated data types. Principals hold vector clocks. Capability grants merge via geometric CRDT operations. The intersection number is computed from eventually-consistent state. This requires the Cliffy protocols geometric CRDT layer.

## Design Principles (Preserved Across All Directions)

1. **No network service.** Schubert remains a library. Deployment patterns (daemon, sidecar, plugin) are the caller's choice.

2. **Identity is external.** Schubert never authenticates. It authorizes against identities provided by the caller.

3. **Mathematics is the authority.** Every access decision has a geometric basis. No heuristic rules, no pattern matching, no ML models.

4. **Synchronous by default.** The core API is synchronous. Async wrappers can be built externally.

5. **Embeddable.** A single dependency. Compiles anywhere Rust compiles. Suitable for kernels, embedded systems, browsers.
