## Current State

Schubert provides a practical access control library built on Schubert calculus.
It is embeddable, synchronous, and depends on `amari-enumerative` v0.22 (plus
optional `karpal-proof`, `karpal-verify`, `serde`, `rayon`, `toml`).
85 unit tests, 0 warnings across all feature combinations.

**Completed since foundation:**
- ✅ IA ecosystem conformance, serde, karpal, parallel, policy, wasm, crypto
- ✅ Computation path selection (4 paths + auto-routing)
- ✅ Serialization roundtrip (AccessController serde + JSON/file I/O)
- ✅ Policy language (declarative TOML)
- ✅ WebAssembly target (wasm32-unknown-unknown)
- ✅ Context-aware decisions (resource scoping + time-aware trust)
- ✅ Multi-Grassmannian controllers (cross-domain access)
- ✅ Proof-carrying capabilities (Ed25519 cryptographic tokens)
- ✅ Constitutional verification (Karpal 0.5.0 integration)
- ✅ AGPL-3.0 dual-licensing

## Near-Term (Practical)

### 1. Computation Path Selection — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** All 4 amari computation paths exposed via `check_with_path()`:
- `LittlewoodRichardson` — exact, classical (default)
- `Localization` — equivariant localization (Atiyah-Bott), better scaling for large Gr(k,n)
- `Tropical` — tropical intersection (fast, approximate counts)
- `Matroid` — polynomial-time independence check

Auto-routing via `check_auto()`: Gr(k,n) with n ≤ 8 uses LR, larger uses Localization.

**Verified:** σ₁⁴=2 and σ₂·σ₁₁=0 consistent across LR, Localization, and Tropical paths.
Matroid correctly detects impossibility.

### 2. Serialization and Persistence — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Full `AccessController` serde with roundtrip fidelity:
- `Serialize` + `Deserialize` on `AccessController` (audit sink skipped)
- `Principal.granted_capability_ids` tracks grants for namespace reconstruction
- `rebuild_principal_namespaces()` restores amari namespaces after deserialization
- `to_json()` / `from_json()` convenience methods
- `save_to_file()` / `load_from_file()` file I/O (requires `std`)

**Verified:** 8 roundtrip tests covering empty controller, capabilities, principals,
access decisions (including σ₁⁴=2 and σ₂·σ₁₁ impossibility), grants, revokes, and file I/O.

### 3. Policy Language — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Declarative TOML policy format with full validation:
- `PolicyConfig` struct with serde Deserialize/Serialize
- `from_policy_toml()` / `to_policy_toml()` on `AccessController`
- Grassmannian validation, partition bounds checks, weakly-decreasing check
- Principal grant reference validation
- `examples/policies/rbac.toml` — complete Kubernetes RBAC policy file

**Verified:** 15 policy tests (parse, validate, apply, roundtrip, error cases, file loading).

### 4. WebAssembly Target — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Full wasm32-unknown-unknown compatibility:
- `wasm` feature propagates to `amari-enumerative/wasm`
- `WasmController` — wasm-bindgen wrapper with full JavaScript API
- `AuditSink` gated behind `std` feature (not available on wasm)
- `InMemoryAudit` uses `RefCell` in no_std, plain `Vec` on wasm
- `now_millis()` returns 0 on wasm32
- CI checks: wasm32 build without features + with `wasm` feature

**Verified:** Compiles cleanly for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with both
`--no-default-features` and `--features wasm`.

### 5. Context-Aware Decisions — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** `AccessContext` with resource, time, and metadata:
- `check_with_context()` extends standard checks with resource scoping
  and time-based trust degradation
- Resource-scoped capabilities: `"cap/resource_id"` checked in addition
  to base capability when context.resource is set
- Time-aware trust: trust factor decays linearly from 1.0 (fresh) to
  0.0 (2+ years old), scaling configuration counts
- Builder methods: `AccessContext::empty()`, `for_resource()`, `at_time()`

**Verified:** 4 tests (resource scoping, empty context matching standard
check, time degradation, no-time no-degradation).

## Medium-Term (Research-Adjacent)

### 6. Multi-Grassmannian Controllers — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** `MultiController` managing multiple Grassmannian domains:
- `add_domain(k, n)` / `add_domain_named(k, n, label)` — register domains
- `create_principal()`, `grant_in_domain()`, `register_in_domain()` — per-domain ops
- `check_in_domain()` — standard check within a domain
- `check_cross_domain()` — translate capabilities between Grassmannians
  via partition validation (fits-in-box check)
- `translatable_capabilities()` — list capabilities compatible across domains
- `domains_for_partition()` — find domains that accept a given partition

**Verified:** 7 tests (add domains, same-domain check, cross-domain translatable,
cross-domain check, denied-if-not-held, partition-based domain discovery,
duplicate label rejection).

### 7. Proof-Carrying Capabilities — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Full cryptographic capability tokens via Ed25519:
- `CapabilityToken` — signed assertion of principal+capability
- `CapabilityIssuer` — generates key pairs and issues signed tokens
- `CapabilityVerifier` — verifies signatures and extracts claims
- `verify_batch()` for parallel verification (behind `parallel` feature)
- Tamper-detection: modified tokens fail signature verification

**Verified:** 6 tests (issue+verify, wrong key, tampered capability,
tampered principal, verify_and_extract, batch issuance).

### 8. Temporal Access Control — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Timed capabilities with automatic expiry:
- `Capability::expires_at` — optional Unix timestamp expiry
- `Capability::with_expiry()` — builder pattern for timed capabilities
- `Capability::is_expired_at()` / `time_remaining_at()` — expiry queries
- `AccessController::check_temporal()` — access checks with expiry awareness
- `expired_capabilities()` / `capability_time_remaining()` — temporal queries
- `temporal_trust_level()` — linear trust decay from grant to expiry

**Verified:** 6 tests (expired denied, no-expiry always allowed, mixed expiry,
expired listing, trust decay, time remaining).

### 9. Quantitative Rate Limiting — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Token-bucket rate limiting scaled by Schubert intersection numbers:
- `RateLimiter` — per-principal token buckets with capacity = intersection_number × multiplier × base_rate
- `configure_principal()` / `configure_from_decision()` — setup from access results
- `try_consume()` / `can_consume()` — token consumption with refill
- `tokens_available()` / `capacity()` — bucket state queries
- Linear refill: tokens replenish at configured rate over time

**Verified:** 7 tests (consume, exhaust, higher-intersection-gets-more,
configure from Granted/Denied, can_consume, remove principal).

## Far-Term (Speculative)

### 10. Schubert Routing

Access decisions as routing rules. A network where route advertisement = capability grants and forwarding = Schubert intersection. The number of valid routes between source and destination is the intersection number. Congestion is codimension excess. This is the networking model explored in the ShaperOS transport layer, extracted as a standalone protocol.

### 11. Surreal Trust Levels

Amari 0.23.0 provides `RationalSurreal` — exact rational surreal numbers
with infinitesimal support via `EpsilonPolynomial` (`amari-surreal` with
`experimental-epsilon` feature). Trust levels become surreal-valued:

| Layer | Example | Meaning |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Finite real | `0.5` | Standard trust |
| General rational | `3/7` | Exact, no floating-point artifacts |
| Infinitesimal | `ε`, `ε²` | Distinct levels within the infinitesimal |
| Mixed | `0.5 + ε` | Half trust plus a shred |

The wall-crossing engine generalizes naturally — the phase φ(t) formula
is analytic in t. See `docs/surreal-trust-levels.md` for the full expansion.

### 12. Constitutional Verification — ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v0.1.0)

Integrated with Karpal 0.5.0 verification infrastructure:
- `verify::schubert_bundle()` — 5 proof obligations
- `verify::certify_capability()` — certified trust boundary
- SMT-LIB2 and Lean 4 export support
- CI: `.github/workflows/schubert-verify.yml`

### 13. Distributed Access Control with CRDTs

Operadic composition over a distributed system using conflict-free replicated data types. Principals hold vector clocks. Capability grants merge via geometric CRDT operations. The intersection number is computed from eventually-consistent state. This requires the Cliffy protocols geometric CRDT layer.

### 14. Access Control for Holographic Memory — ✅ DONE (v0.1.0)

**Implemented:** Holographic memory access control via Minuet 0.3.0:
- `HolographicAccessControl` — bridges Schubert calculus with holographic memory
- `check_holo_access()` — combines Schubert intersection + holographic similarity
- `HoloAccessResult` — granted, configurations, similarity, threshold
- `accessible_at_trust()` — wall-crossing at holographic trust levels
- Uses `SimpleStore<ProductCliffordAlgebra<32>>` for holographic trace storage

**Verified:** 7 tests (register/grant, denied, Schubert+holo, threshold,
accessible, unit norm, self-similarity).

## Design Principles (Preserved Across All Directions)

1. **No network service.** Schubert remains a library. Deployment patterns (daemon, sidecar, plugin) are the caller's choice.

2. **Identity is external.** Schubert never authenticates. It authorizes against identities provided by the caller.

3. **Mathematics is the authority.** Every access decision has a geometric basis. No heuristic rules, no pattern matching, no ML models.

4. **Synchronous by default.** The core API is synchronous. Async wrappers can be built externally.

5. **Embeddable.** A single dependency. Compiles anywhere Rust compiles. Suitable for kernels, embedded systems, browsers.
